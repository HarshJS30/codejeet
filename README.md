# Responsive Currency Converter in React

This project is a **responsive currency converter** built with **React**. It uses APIs to fetch currency conversion rates and allows users to convert between different currencies.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Currency Conversion**: The app allows users to convert from one currency to another by inputting the amount and selecting currencies.
- **API Integration**: It fetches real-time exchange rates using an API.

## Future Implementation

In the next steps, I plan to implement the feature for checking the price of any stock using an API, allowing users to get the latest stock prices directly from the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **API**: For fetching real-time data for currency conversion.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and making it responsive.

## Getting Started
